# Simulation-of-parallel-mirrors
This was my CG project in college 

  This project basically deals with the simulation of the infinite reflections that occur
when two mirrors are placed parallel to one another. It provides the reflections at different
views. Initially minimum number of reflections are shown in the output. By using the keys
the user can select the different number of reflections he wishes to observe. If the user presses
the '+' key the reflections goes on increasing. Similarly when the user presses the '-' key the
reflections goes on decreasing. The user can also wish to view the complete reflections on
both mirrors from top view.
  We have coded the project in C as it is easily understandable by users. We have used
OpenGL as it provides a easy platform for simulating such animations.
